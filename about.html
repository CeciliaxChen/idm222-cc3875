                <p> I am a sophomore at Drexel University, majoring in UXID (User Experience and Interaction Design). Also minoring in Psychology, I am planning on graduating spring term of June 2025 at Drexel University. </p>

            <div class = "about__deeper-1">
                <p> In my first year at Drexel, I went through many fields of study that I possibly wanted to major in. A lot of them were offered at Westphal, but a lot of them were not. However, in the end, I seemed to settle on what felt right to me: User Experience and Interaction Design (UXID). From my freshman year being in the midst of a world-wide pandemic, the time I had allowed me to reflect on my wants for my career, my needs as a human, and my desires for my daily happinness. However, only having UXID as a major did not seem to satisfy a certain hunger. I had always considered majoring in Psychology, but I could not due to certain circumstances. Minoring was the only way, and I felt such a huge sigh of relief when I was not being pressured to choose one or the other. </p>

                <p> Some small aspects about me are that noteworthy is that I animated cartoons, animated series on most platforms, I considering watching k-dramas and anime as hobbies, and so many more fun facts. I am very clumsy but also I love to play volleyball. I have cat-eared shaped nostrils and I have been embarrassed about it my entire life. </p>
